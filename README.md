# DogTags

## Description

This was a project between [Sam-Jaya](https://github.com/Sam-Jaya), [lkelsall](https://github.com/lkelsall), [Fieldy618](https://github.com/Fieldy618) and [paulor26](https://github.com/PaulOR26).

The aim was to build a mobile app that uses machine learning technology to identify a dog breed from a photo of the dog. The app also stores a history of the user's dog cards.
